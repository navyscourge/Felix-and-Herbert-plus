# Felix and Herbert plus
Scratch beginner, tutor led

This is a reworking of the Code Club project Felix and Herbert for starting with Scratch. The project has been dropped from the Term 1 curriculum on the grounds that it introduces too many elements for an initial lesson.

The project and tutor notes should be used to lead the class, children or adults, through the code explaining how the code would be developed, coded and checked. The aim is to introduce Scratch and to show what is possible. It is expected that the class will be given additional projects to work through on their own, referring back to this project if necessary. The tutor notes can be distributed to the class after the project has been completed.
